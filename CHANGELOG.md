- `Voltage` values are now stored as `i64` internally (from `i32`)
- `Current` values are now stored as `u64` internally (from `u32`)
- `Resistance` extension traits renamed to `ResistanceFromInteger` and `ResistanceFromFloat`
- `Voltage` extension traits renamed to `VoltageFromInteger` and `VoltageFromFloat`
- `Current` extension traits renamed to `CurrentFromInteger` and `CurrentFromFloat`

### Removed
